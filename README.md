# lime-sentiment

This project is about using LIME algorithm developed by M. Tulio Ribeiro, S. Singh and C. Guestrin (2016, Washington University) for Free JAR data.
These data associate, for each product x judge, a description to a hedonic categorization (0 = "I don't like it" and 1 = "I like it a lot"). We aim to highlight the words that contributed most to the asignment of the description to the hedonic categorization, thanks to LIME. The weight assigned to each word then allow us to calculate a sentiment score. This is a LIME application to Sentiment Analysis.
